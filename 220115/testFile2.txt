lseek â€” move the read/write file offset.

The  lseek() function shall set the file offset for the open file description associated with the file descriptor fildes, as follows:

- If whence is SEEK_SET, the file offset shall be set to offset bytes.

- If whence is SEEK_CUR, the file offset shall be set to its current location plus offset.

- If whence is SEEK_END, the file offset shall be set to the size of the file plus offset.
